**White Paper: AI-Driven Tokenized NSE Listed Asset's Trading Platform on Hedera Blockchain**

**1. Introduction**
The financial markets in Kenya, particularly the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), present opportunities for retail investors. However, barriers such as complex trading processes, high fees, and lack of real-time analytics hinder participation. This white paper proposes an AI-driven tokenized trading platform leveraging the Hedera Blockchain and MERN stack to democratize access to NSE-listed companies' tokenized assets.

**2. Problem Statement**
Retail traders in Kenya face several challenges:
- **Complexity in Trading**: Traditional brokerage services require manual processes, limiting accessibility.
- **High Transaction Costs**: Brokerage and bank fees deter small-scale traders.
- **Limited Market Insights**: Lack of AI-driven predictive analytics for retail traders.
- **Liquidity Issues**: Difficulties in buying/selling assets efficiently.

**3. Solution Overview**
This platform will enable users to trade tokenized NSE-listed assets using Hedera Hashgraph’s fast, secure, and low-cost infrastructure. AI agents will provide trade predictions, market insights, risk assessment, and automated trading strategies.
